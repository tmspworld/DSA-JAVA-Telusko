  How do calculate the Time?
    Machine give deferent Time so time calculate is depend on Machine to Machine
     So we calculate with the help of steps 

Seaching an element in a sorted array
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

  - Linear Search: 5 7 9 12 17
  Here we Search 12 
  taget_value = 12 
  It start to sea from first then second then go on until match
